## About this project

### Where does Finland export arms? In what direction does global arms trade develop? How do countries prevent conflicts by monitoring and restricting arms trade and military actions? The Finnish Arms Control Report provides information about trends in arms trade and developments in arms control in Finland and in the world at large.

# Terms Used in the Map

## Military Material
A product or service which has been planned, manufactured or sold specifically for military use. In the Finnish legislation, the term ”puolustustarvike” or defence material is used. Military material does not include consumer goods used by the military, e.g. biscuits, boots and computers. 
 
## Civilian Arms
A product or service, which has been planned, manufactured and sold specifically for consumer use. Potential uses are, for example, hunting, competitive shooting and other gun hobbies. Due to the Finnish export licencing system, some guns and ammunition exports sold to the military and other officials of different countries may also be included in the Finnish civilian arm exports.

## Dual-Use Goods
A product or service, which is intended for civilian use but which can be used to improve military capabilities or in the production of weapons of mass destruction. 

## Total
Military material and civilian arms.

## Global Peace Index
Measures peacefulness using different indicators. The state of peace is divided into five categories from very low to very high.

# Reading the Report

The Finnish Arms Control Report is produced by SaferGlobe, Finland’s leading independent think tank on peace and security. The report shows trends in international arms sales and arms control as well as how these trends are reflected in the policies promoted by Finland. It also shows where Finland exports arms, and where it imports arms from. 

The countries represented on the map are the end user states of the products. However, the arms may be used elsewhere too. Whenever the purchaser is the military of the state in question or other officials, the states decide in which military operations the arms are used. If instead, the buyer is a company, it can resell the products to a third state. 

The annual variation in the size of arms exports is notable as arms systems are expensive, they are rarely bought, and deliveries of completed orders can happen in the same year. To show development in the arms trade policies in the longer term, arms exports are often shown in segments of 5 years

The information in the report is shown in euros, but the euro sums do not directly convey the significance of the export in question.  Significance requires consideration of what products were exported, to whom and for what purpose.  It is also worth considering how significant the proportion of the export is both in terms of its type and in relation to arms exports  for that country in general. However, even one bullet can kill, and with one assault rifle it is possible to shoot thousands of cartridges over its lifespan.

# Presentation of Information

The report shows the number of actual arms exports from Finland. Exports require an export licence issued by the Finnish authorities. These licences are typically valid for one or three years. A granted export licence does not necessarily mean that the export licence would be used. However, the export licences show the kind of export policies Finland has and what kind of arms trade is considered to be in line with Finnish foreign and security politics. In considerations of political responsibility, it is insufficient to focus on the actual exports, but rather evaluation should also include circumstances around the granting of the export licence including potential encouragement to begin negotiations. More detailed information on the Finnish Export Licensing system can be found here [(Suomen asevientilupajärjestelmä)](articles/18).

The euro total may not be the same as in the trade contract but may vary, for example, due to added services or taxes. When exporting licensing for production, the later exports from the country of production will not be shown in the reports of Finnish authorities, nor in this report. 

The exports of military material are from the [reports of the Ministry of Defence](http://www.defmin.fi/tehtavat_ja_toiminta/puolustushallinnon_voimavarat/puolustustarvikkeiden_vienti_siirto_kauttakuljetus_ja_valitys/tilastot), which is the responsible authority in Finland for export licencing of military material.  The export licences are public documents and have been attained by a freedom of information request.  

The exports of civilian arms are from the [Uljas System for Distribution of Foreign Trade Statistics from the Finnish Customs](http://tulli.fi/en/statistics/uljas-database).  The export licences of civilian arms are confidential and thus not accessible for use in this report. For civilian arms, the responsible licencing authority is the National Police Board in Finland. Due to limited resources and gaps in the information system in use, it has not been able to collect data on how many export licences have been granted to each state in recent years. Information on export licences for dual-use items are from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attained by a freedom of information request.
 
The export data is compared to the [Global Peace Index](http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/) which is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace. Currently, the index is the most useful tool to estimate in very general terms the probability of a state increasing both violence itself as well as support for the structures enabling violence.  The index uses 23 quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure internal and external conflict, societal security and militarization.

# Read More

[In the background section](articles) we have collected analyses of arms control, different treaties, arms licensing systems and general development of arms trade. On the page “cases”, we have collected articles on individual arms exports.

[In the metadata](downloads), you will find the differences between export licences, transfer licences, transhipments, information on the origin of the data used here, as well as the different customs classifications that include civilian arms.

# SaferGlobe

The Finnish Arms Control (ISSN 2342-3447) is published by [SaferGlobe](https://saferglobe.fi/). SaferGlobe is an independent peace and security think tank, which studies and develops tools for the promotion of lasting peace and security. 

The Finnish Arms Control Report aims to both improve transparency in arms trade as well as develop Finnish and international research and expertise in international arms control. Our understanding is that conflicts can be mitigated or even prevented through monitoring and controlling arms exports.

The Finnish Arms Control Report is developed by SaferGlobe. It has been published since 2010.  The  report has had the following contributors: Eekku Aromaa, Mikko Autti, Pamela Baarman, Tarja Cronberg, Tuuli Hongisto, Jouko Huru, Frank Johansson, Mira Kajo, Anne Koivula, Elli Kytömäki, Johannes Lehtinen, Honna Marttila, Maria Mekri, Henri Myrttinen, Kari Paasonen, Jarmo Pykälä, Mert Sasioglu, Eeva Simola, Eeva Suhonen, Milja Suihko, Paavo Teittinen, Timmy Trümpler, Hannele Tulkki, Hanna Tuulonen, Ville Uusitupa, Otso Vainio and Nora Westerlund. 

The printing and development of the report has been supported in 2010–2016 by the [Finnish Section of Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.fi/), [Peace Union of Finland](http://www.rauhanliitto.fi/), [Changemaker Youth Network of the Finn Church Aid](https://www.changemaker.fi), [Finnish Peace Committee](https://www.rauhanpuolustajat.org/), [Committee of 100 in Finland](http://www.sadankomitea.fi/), [Physicians for Social Responsibility](https://lsv.fi/) and [the Leo Mechelin Foundation](http://www.leomechelinsaatio.fi). SaferGlobe has also used general funding from the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland to produce the report.

Reports on arms trade from 2008–2015 are available [here](downloads). Some of the articles from these reports are also featured on the [articles page](articles). 

This database and the website has been made possible by [Futurice's](http://futurice.com/) [Chilicorn Fund](https://spiceprogram.org/chilicorn-fund/).
